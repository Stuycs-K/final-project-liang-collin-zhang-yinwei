## Overview
Simple Cuphead Game, a shooter/platformer-esque game. Project will revolve around projectile motion (particle shooting, accelerations, parrying, gravity, bounces). Boss will have simple motion and attack patterns, particles will follow basic physics, sprites will not be affected by external forces. 
## Instructions
This demo project is a stripped down version of the main app due to memory issues. Simply fly the plane and use space to parry projectiles backward to the boss.
