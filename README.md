# APCS2 Final Project

## Group Info
**ANG Studios** with Collin Liang & Yinwei Zhang

Mr. K, Period 3

## Overview
Our project is a Cuphead-inspired parrying game.
The project revolves around projectile motion (particle, accelerations, parrying, gravity, bounces).
The Boss has a unique attack pattern, and the particles will follow basic physics, sprites are fully hand-drawn.

Your **Supercharge meter** and **health** is displayed on the bottom left of the screen. The meter will determine your ability to parry.
It is naturally restored over time. The boss has the **Beam** attack, **Fireball** attack, and the **Gem** attack. By parrying the boss's projectiles back at it, we may defeat it.

## Running
No external libraries are required to run this. Simply open the project in Processing and click run.

## Directions
Use **WASD** to move. Beware that your plane is affected by the oncoming wind. An icon will indicate your movement.

Hold **Space** to parry, it costs your Supercharge, and your plane will be disabled.  An icon will indicate your status.

Dodge the bouncing **Fireball** and the straight **Beam** attack, or parry them. When the boss is low on health,
it will start the **Gem** attack, which will spawn spreading projectiles repeatedly. Get close to it, and parry it back!

Hold **H** to quickly lower the boss's health!

## Major Issues
None. Parrying is difficult, but this is intended. Position yourself in front of the projectile, then await its arrival.
