# Work Log

## Collin Liang

### 05/22/24
Implemented abstract Attack class, made files, and handled run technicalities.

### 05/23/24
Implemented some code for Beam and most of the code for Projectile. Ran test to make sure code for Projectile forces and velocity and displacement works.

### 05/24/24
Moved Beam to later developmental stage. Implemented basic enact (tick function), gravity, and forces for Projectile.

### 05/28/24
Figured out logic for hitboxes for both sprites and projectiles

### 05/29/24
Implemented Boss and Sprite Classes, implemented Boss into tester

### 05/30/24
Worked on boss functionality, figured out final hitboxes for boss and basic attacks

### 05/31/24
Figured out parry implementation logic, prepped projectile and attack for parry

### 06/02/24
Implemented parry and created workable rudamentary sprites and moving background for presentable demo, worked on linear plane movement mode

### 06/04/24
Changed main branch back to more workable linear plane motion and improved parry logic/handling
